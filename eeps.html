            <p>Education is a fundamental part of Spacesim, and is promoted both internally, within our club, and externally through our
            Elementary Education Programs.</p>


            <p>EEPs are given by Spacesim members, and are exceptionally fun and engaging for both their audiences and presenters.
            Demonstrations take concepts of astronomy, physics and space travel, and break them down for younger audiences in ways that are
            easier to understand, and make learning enjoyable.</p>


            <p>Presentations can be adjusted to cover specific topics, and for children of different ages and levels of understanding.
            These presentations are available for elementary school classes, day camps, and other private groups. Below is a list of
            demonstrations we currently offer, including the average amount of time each takes.</p>


            <p>For more information, or to request an EEPs or planetarium presentation, please contact us through our contact form which is
            located <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>EEPs Demonstrations</h3>
            <!-- Newtonian physics panel -->

                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h4>Newtonian Physics</h4>
                </div>


                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>In our Newtonâ€™s Laws demonstration, presenters teach the basic properties of motion: inertia, friction, and
                    momentum. Our hovercraft is frequently used to model motion in a frictionless environment, and how this affects
                    astronauts working in space. Audience members are encouraged to take part in the demonstration, and extra time can be
                    given for hovercraft rides at the end of the presentation. (30-45 min.)</p>

            <!-- Rocketry panel -->

                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h4>Rocketry</h4>
                </div>


                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>In our rocketry demonstration, presenters will teach their audience about means of propulsion, and the fundamentals
                    of orbits. A scale model of the Saturn V rocket is used to illustrate how the stages of rockets work. (20-30 min.)</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <!-- Phases of the moon panel -->


            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-heading">
                    <h4>Phases of the Moon</h4>
                </div>


                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>In this demonstration, presenters will teach their audience about why the moon appears to change its shape over the
                    course of a month and the names of the moon in each of its phases. Presenters also explain why some constellations are
                    only visible at certain times of year, how the rotation of the Earth on its axis causes our cycle of day and night, and
                    how its tilt causes seasonal changes. This is an excellent presentation for younger audiences, who are beginning to
                    develop and interest in astronomy. (20-30 min.)</p>
